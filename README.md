### Simon History

Also known for creating the first video game system, inventor **Ralph Baer** and his coworker **Howard Morrison** developed the Simon game inspired by an Atari arcade game called _Touch Me_.

Named after the children's game of _Simon Says_, the game was released by **Milton Bradley Company** in 1978 with a midnight release party at Studio 54, the elite disco in NYC at the time.
